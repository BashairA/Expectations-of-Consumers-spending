# Expectations of Consumers spending
Studying individualsâ€™ behavior in expected spending through observation is the main propose of this analysis
which will be determined by the future conditions of buying a vehicle.
# Questions:
1- Does consumer sentiment economically illustrate information about future consumer spending?

2-Does an optimistic view about future personal finance demonstrate information about expected consumer spending?

3-What is the effect of other factors such as expected inflation rate, expected unemployment rate, expected interest rate, 
expected change in prices, and expected business conditions for the country on future spending?

# The dataset:
The data used in the paper is the Surveys of Consumers by University of Michigan. The Surveys of Consumers has been managed by 
the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan since 1946.
Each month, 500 individuals are randomly selected from the contiguous
United States (48 states plus the District of Columbia) to participate in the Surveys of Consumers. 
The questions asked cover three broad areas of consumer confidence:
personal finances, business conditions, and future buying plans. The data period used in this study is monthly since 1997 until 2017.
